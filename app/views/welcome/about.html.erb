<h3>Use Case</h3>

<p>
  There are plenty of good analytic services, but that doesn't mean you
  can't build a better one. Your analytics service will offer a few key
  features:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to track events
    on their website.</li>
  <li>A server-side API that captures and saves those events to a
    database.</li>
  <li>A Rails application that displays the captured event data for a
    user.</li>
</ul>
